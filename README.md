    # Or using uv:
    uv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    # Using pip:
    pip install -e screengpt

    # Or using uv:
    uv pip install -e screengpt
    ```

## Usage
### Start the Application:
```sh
python -m screengpt
```
or use provided Windows X64 executable. 

- Enter your OpenAI-compatible API key when prompted.
- The default settings use the OpenRouter base URL with the free model: google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free.
- Obtain your API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).
- Modify the system and user prompts as needed; the default prompt is designed for game copilot assistance.
- Adjust the hotkey to your preference.
- Click "Apply Settings" to start the application. The settings will be saved in config.ini, so you wonâ€™t need to re-enter them next time.
- Press the hotkey (default: Ctrl+Alt+E) to capture a screenshot; the response will be displayed both on screen and in the terminal.
